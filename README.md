## about
Allows the GNOME top panel to be visible on fullscreen, either in static mode or dynamic mode. Toggle between them by right-clicking the top panel. Static mode means the top panel is ALWAYS visible on fullscreen; Dynamic mode means it's only visible if moving your cursor to the topside of the screen.
